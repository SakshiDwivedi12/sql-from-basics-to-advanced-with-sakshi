# sql-from-basics-to-advanced-with-sakshi
This repository showcases my SQL learning journey, covering fundamentals to advanced concepts including complex queries, joins, subqueries, window functions, and performance optimization. It includes hands-on projects focused on real-world data analysis, analytics, and enterprise-style database use cases.
About This Repository
This repository documents my end-to-end SQL learning journey, focused on building strong fundamentals and advanced, real-world SQL skills through hands-on practice and projects.
The learning approach emphasizes conceptual clarity and practical implementation, covering how SQL works internally and how it is applied in enterprise data environments. Instead of relying only on theory, the focus is on writing efficient queries, understanding execution logic, and solving real business problems using SQL.
The content and projects in this repository are inspired by real-world data use cases commonly seen in data analytics, business intelligence, and software engineering roles.
